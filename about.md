title: Developer 🥑 Advocate
---

Seb has been writing code since he first laid his hands
on a Commodore 64 in the mid‑eighties. Since then, he has watched
programming languages evolve, architectures transform, and the cloud
redefine how modern systems are built. Today, he is a Developer Advocate
at Amazon Web Services, helping builders get the most out of the cloud,
with a constant obsession: performance, simplicity, and technical
elegance. His favorite playgrounds? Distributed architectures, developer
tools, mobile computing... and everything that enables teams to ship
faster, safer, and at scale.

A regular speaker at AWS Summit, a blogger on the [AWS News
Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/stormacq/) (aka "Jeff's
blog"), host of the official [AWS 🇫🇷
Podcast](https://sebs.to/paef), and contributor to
the Belgian tech podcast [Les Technos](http://lestechnos.be/), Sébastien
enjoys explaining complex topics with concrete examples and code that
compiles. Before that, he led the [AWS Technical
Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) teams across EMEA and the
[Alexa Solution Architecture](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa#) teams
in Southern Europe. 

His driving forces: curiosity, knowledge sharing,
and one simple conviction --- if it cannot be automated through an API,
there is probably still work to do.
